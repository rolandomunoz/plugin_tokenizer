# Tokenizer

Segment an annotation at different levels (words, syllables and segments) and store the results as new tiers.

# Getting Started

## 1. How to set it up
**Step 1:** Let the Plug-in to know which segments are used in your transcriptions. In the Praat menu, go to `Tokenizer > Settings > Set segments...`

**Step 2:** A dialog box will appear. In the first box, write all the vowels that are used in your transcriptions. In the second box, write only the consonants that are supported by 2 or more [characters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Character_(computing)). In both cases, you will need to separate the segment units using white spaces. When this is done, click on _Continue_. Now, you are ready to use the Plug-in. 

In the Figure, `a~ e~ i~ o~ u~` represent nasal vowels, while `tS ts` stands for affricates.

## 2. How to use it

The Tokenizer plug-in provides you methods to work with TextGrids either one-by-one or collectively.  

### 2.1. Working with TextGrids one-by-one

In order you can work with one TextGrid at a time, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Open a TextGrid file in the Praat Objects window. [See an example](http://i.imgur.com/c6nUlA6l.png)
 
**Step 2:** When you select it, an `Add tokenized tier...` button will appear in the bottom part of the Dynamic menu. Click on it.

**Step 3:** A dialog box will pop up. Here, write the name of tier that will be used as the starting point for the segmentation task. Then, check which segmented tier you would like to add to your TextGrid. Press on _Continue_

**Step 4:** Open your TextGrid in the Editor window. Look, it is now segmented! [See an example](http://i.imgur.com/2SN7S6Il.png)

## 3. Practice yourself
Here, you will find a collection of TextGrids. Download the files and practice.
