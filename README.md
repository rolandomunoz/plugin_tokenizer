# Tokenizer

A praat plugin which can tokenize an input tier into a word, syllable, or segment tier 

The Figure from below is an example how this plug-in works. The three topmost tiers (segment, syllable, word)  were derived from the fourth one (text). We can also observe that the segmented units are delimited by intervals.
